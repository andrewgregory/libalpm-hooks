=head1 HOOKS vs INSTALL SCRIPTS

Hooks and scripts each fill a different packaging niche.  Install scripts are
included directly in the package that runs them and are run immediately prior
to installation or removal of the package.  Hooks may be provided by any
package, not necessarily the one(s) that trigger it, or the user and are run
before or after the transaction.  Hooks are generally preferable for any tasks
that need to be repeated for a number of packages.  Any essential tasks (e.g.
rebuilding the initramfs after a kernel update) should either be run in
a C<PreTransaction> hook or continue to use an install script due to the risk
of post-transaction hooks not running if the transaction is interrupted.
